# we-lend

## A community based collateral-free lending platform built over blockchain.

A user who connects to this platform joins a community or a interest group. When the user requires money he can file a loan directly
from a money lender and in return promises a contract for returning the money. This contract is actually the total sum of money he borrowed
which gets deducted from all the members of the same community. 

If the user is able to return the money to the money lender on time the contract is broken and the collected money is returned back 
the respective person but if he is unable to return the money the contract goes to the money lender 

The platform issues rating to the user. lower rating means less amount of loan can be requested. And the rating depends on the performance 
the user 

if he pays loan on time the rating goes up and he can ask for a greater loan but if he fails the rating goes down and he can only ask loan 
of lesser amount

Once the rating goes very low, he can even be kicked out of the community
